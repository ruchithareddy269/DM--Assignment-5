Data preparation and Processing

Using popular kaggle data sets, perform the following tasks:

EDA
Data preparation
Processing
we will perform the following tasks:

Choose a dataset (a combination of balanced and unbalanced datasets) for each of the following dataset types:

Tabular diverse set of data types like nyc taxi  :

Timeseries    
Spatio temporal    
image (use kerascv or popular package)    
audio    
video (action recognition)    
graph data set (pick any popular like citation etc.,.)        


For each of the data sets listed above, perform the following actions: A. Perform Detailed EDA. B. Perform detailed Data preprocessing/cleaning. (You can use autoEDA and autoDS together with your manual insights and autoML, such as sagemaker or Azure). C. Perform clustering and anomaly eliminations in the data sets. Perform all steps in data preparation including feature processing and feature selection. D. Build various ML models using autoML including ensemble model E. Write one medium paper of how you leveraged GPT-4 code interpreter to perform all of these steps for each of the datasets and your experience in doing so.
